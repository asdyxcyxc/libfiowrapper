# Performance
The performance test was done on the libpng library with readpng console application. Original source code is available [here](./examples/libpng/readpng.c).

## Setup
For this test, two cases ware prepared. Original file was changed to be fuzzed in the persistent mode and the persistent mode with libfiowrapper. Following diff shows differences between the files. As it can be seen, only few addition lines were added for the libfiowrapper.

The following commands were used to build the executables:
```
afl-clang-fast readpng-fiow.c -o readpng-fiow ./libpng-code/afl-build/libpng16.a -lz -lm -L../../ -lfiowrapper -I./libpng-code/afl-build -I./libpng-code
```
```
afl-clang-fast readpng-pers.c -o readpng-pers ./libpng-code/afl-build/libpng16.a -lz -lm -I./libpng-code/afl-build -I./libpng-code
```

## Results:
There were 4 tests performed, each took 4 hours with the AFL++. In every case the same seed was used.  The following command was used:
```
afl-fuzz  -i ./input-png/ -o ./output  -s 1234 -V 14400 -p seek -M fiow -m none -- ./readpng-fiow @@

afl-fuzz  -i ./input-png/ -o ./output  -s 1234 -V 14400 -p seek -M pers -m none -- ./readpng-pers @@
```
Here are the results:

|   | Persistent Mode  | libfiowrapper  |
|---|---|---|
| Total execs (Avg) | 76,5M | 140M |
| Total paths | 1860 | 1940 |
| Total crashes | 1 (1 unique) | 1 (1 unique) |


Here are the statistics from the example single run:
